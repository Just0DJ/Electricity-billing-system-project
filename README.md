# Electricity-billing-system-project
The Electricity Billing System is a backend project developed in Python with MySQL, featuring over 800 lines of code and ASCII printing. Inspired by my dad's expertise, it uses several Python extensions for efficient billing management. While basic, it provides a solid foundation for backend development and database integration.
